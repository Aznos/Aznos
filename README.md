## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I primarily work with Kotlin, especially in the Minecraft ecosystem using Fabric and PaperMC. For web development, I use the MERN stack, and I dabble in C from time to time.

Some of my projects:
- [BulletMC](https://github.com/BulletMC/Bullet): My favorite project, recreating the minecraft protocol from scratch - check it out!
- [Superenchants](https://modrinth.com/plugin/superenchants): A plugin for papermc that adds extra enchantments
- [QuakeOS](https://github.com/Aznos/Quake): My own OS experiment

Iâ€™m always open to collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you want to work on something together!
